# Teardown-Textbox-UI

This is a textbox object for Teardown UI. Started when I made my first Teardown mod, the Molotov. I made this because there was no alternative available at the time.

Since it's creation I've upkept it and used it through various mods such as the Chaos Mod, Thruster Tool, Forcefield and extensively in the Moddy Weapon.

I will eventually make some docs on how to use this. For now feel free to look around my code or ask me through issues here on Github.
